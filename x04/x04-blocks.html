  <h2>Brief</h2>
  <p style="text-align:justify">
    <span style="color:#483D8B">Alan Mathison Turing</span>  <span style="color:red">(23 June 1912 - 7 June 1954)</span> was a pioneering English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span> machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span> is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
During the Second World War, <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span> worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre. For a time he led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method and an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span> played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic; it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by as many as four years.
After the war, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the ACE, among the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948 <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span> joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis, and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.
Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when such behaviour was still a criminal act in the UK. He accepted treatment with DES (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span> died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is equally consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated." Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013.

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span> was born in Maida Vale, London, while his father, Julius Mathison <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span> (1873-1947), was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service (ICS) at Chhatrapur, Bihar and Orissa Province, in British India. <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span>'s father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev. John Robert <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span>, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet. <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span>'s mother, Julius' wife, was Ethel Sara (née Stoney; 1881-1976), daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways. The Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford, while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare.
Julius' work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the Bengal Army. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to Maida Vale, London, where <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span> was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a #483D8B plaque on the outside of the house of his birth, later the Colonnade Hotel. He had an elder brother, John (the father of Sir John Dermot <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span>, 12th Baronet of the <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span> baronets).
Turing's father's civil service commission was still active and during <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span>'s childhood years <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span>'s parents travelled between Hastings in England and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings, <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span> stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked with a #483D8B plaque.
Very early in life, <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span> showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span> lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a #483D8B plaque.

        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">On 8 June 1954, <span style="color:#483D8B">Turing</span>'s housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A post-mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide, it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954.</p>
